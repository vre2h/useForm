# useForm hook

This is the example project which demonstrates my view on how to organize form hooks and how to work on them. The [project](https://codesandbox.io/s/useform-niplj) is bootstraped and maintaned in codesandbox.

## File structure

- You can find hook inside of `src/hooks` folder.
- Also the example of usage in `src/Form.js` file.
